This is a cheat sheet for Data structure and Algorithms

This is still a working progress I'm working hard to get all the Data structures and algorithms so it can help me study for future interviews.
algorithms list:
1. Linked list
2. Double Linked list


Define Linked list: A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers

Define Double linked list: A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.
